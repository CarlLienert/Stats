*The following data is a (small) sample of temperatures in Boston in mid-October. Download the data.*

```{r}
BostonTemps <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/jqh2fsx4qoc8ex3/BostonTemps.csv?dl=1")
head(BostonTemps)
```

*Do a little EDA on the average temperatures. Comment on the distribution.*


```{r}

```



*Perform the Method of Moments procedure to fit a gamma distribution to the data.  That is, determine the values of $\lambda$ and $r$ that make a gamma distribution best fit the data.*


```{r}

```


*Plot the resulting gamma distribution superimposed on a histogram of the data set.*

```{r}

```


*Perform the initial steps in the goodness of fit process.  Just up to the table.  Don't worry about the $\chi^2$ part.*


```{r}

```



*Do you think a gamma distribution models Boston temps in October well?  Why or why not?*
